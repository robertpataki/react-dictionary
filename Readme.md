# React Dictionary App

I am building a simple web app, which is very similar to the notebooks kids use at school to put an expression on the left, and the meaning on the right. This dictionary is pocket ready, so you can have it with you anywhere, and the searching feature makes it easy to find translations.

This is a demo project with the aim to help Amy (the bestest girlfriend ever) to learn Hungarian, and at the same time to help me to learn React/Redux/Firebase/Heroku/ES6/Webpack etc.

At the moment the app is heavily work in progress, and only available through invitation.

If you are interested, and would be happy to help me with testing the app, awesome - drop me a line (robert at robertpataki dot com)!

## Dev notes
